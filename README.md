# From Design to Optimized Design: An Algorithmic Based Approach 

This repository aims to provide the code (partially) and the results 
obtained during the optimization processes. These results refer to 
the paper published on the 36th eCAADe conference on 2018 and which is

## Abstract

Stringent requirements of efficiency and sustainability lead to the demand for buildings that have good performance regarding different criteria, such as cost, lighting, thermal, and structural, among others. Optimization can be used to ensure that such requirements are met. In order to optimize a design, it is necessary to generate different variations of the design, and to evaluate each variation regarding the intended criteria. Currently available design and evaluation tools often demand manual and time-consuming interventions, thus limiting design variations, and causing architects to completely avoid optimization or to postpone it to later stages of the design, when its benefits are diminished. To address these limitations, we propose Algorithmic Optimization, an algorithmic-based approach that combines an algorithmic description of building designs with automated simulation processes and with optimization processes. We test our approach on a daylighting optimization case study and we benchmark different optimization methods. Our results show that the proposed workflow allows to exclude manual interventions from the optimization process, thus enabling its automation. Moreover, the proposed workflow is able to support the architect in the choice of the optimization method, as it enables him to easily switch between different optimization methods.
